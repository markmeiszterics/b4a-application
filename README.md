# B4A Android App | Dashboard | Login | Registration | SQLite

The application's display language is Hungarian, but it is coded in English, so it will be easy to understand.
The backend uses SQLite for the database, sooner I will create an other repo for using it with an actual (direct) sql server.

## History

Project is made during professional practice for developing applications for Android/iOS/Windows using the crossplatform based [B4X](http://www.b4x.com). For me it was the introduction to the Visual Basic language with the understanding of B4A.


## Documentation

The entire project is made with a local sqlite database which is available in the Files folder.\
Keep in mind that this is a very starter get-to-know example program.

You can Register and Login to access the Dashboard. 
Premade account login(username: admin, pass: admin)\

In the future the app will be capable to work with a remote sql server. 

Enjoy coding ‚ù§
